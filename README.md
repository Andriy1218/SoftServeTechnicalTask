SoftServe Technical Task
Requirements in the Net.CSC_test.pdf file.

**A few comments on the implementation:**
1) I know that storing a large hierarchical data structure as one-to-many links is a bad idea. For such cases, there are [better options](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4048151/what-are-the-options-for-storing-hierarchical-data-in-a-relational-database). But since this is just a test task, I chose the easiest way.
2) Unfortunately I did not have time to write tests. At the last minute created a test project with only a couple of tests.
3) A detailed description of all methods is displayed in swagger

4) Web api was tested with Postman
